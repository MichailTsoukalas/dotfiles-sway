# dotfiles-sway
WIP - dotfiles and misc for swaywm under Debian Bookworm / testing

These are configs, firmware, files and notes for my personal system.
I do not propose that you use them, they are WIP and untested on anything but my metal.

Inspired (read: shamelessly stolen) by this swaywm setup script - https://github.com/drewgrif/scripts/blob/main/sway.sh
Will eventually write my own installation script... or just use Fedora Sway instead.
