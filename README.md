# dotfiles-sway

These are configs, firmware, files and notes for setting up SwayWM on Debian 12.
I do not propose that you use them, they are WIP and untested on anything but my system.

Inspired (read: shamelessly stolen) by this swaywm setup script - https://github.com/drewgrif/scripts/blob/main/sway.sh
Will eventually write my own installation script... or just use Fedora Sway instead.
