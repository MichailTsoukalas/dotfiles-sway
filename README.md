# dotfiles-sway
WIP - dotfiles and misc for swaywm under Debian Bookworm / testing


These are configs and notes for my personal system.
I do not propose that you use them, they are WIP and untested on anything but my system.

Inspired by https://github.com/drewgrif 's setup, derived from their swaywm setup script - https://github.com/drewgrif/scripts/blob/main/sway.sh
